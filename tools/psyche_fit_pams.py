"""Fit a PSYCHE construct graph on real PAMS data -- or say why it cannot be done.

THE POINT OF THIS TOOL IS THE REFUSAL
-------------------------------------
`PersonNetwork.fit_edges` estimates partial correlations between named
constructs. That only means anything if the rows it consumes are construct
MEASUREMENTS: for each timestamp, a value per node. PAMS is an episodic memory
store -- memories, conversations, tool calls -- and a memory row is not a state
reading. Its columns are `content`, `memory_type`, `tags`, `importance_level`.

So the interesting question is not "what does the graph look like" but "does any
store in this workspace carry a per-construct reading at all". This tool answers
that by PROBING, in a fixed order, and refuses when the answer is no:

  0. an elicitation store       (`tools/elicit.py` JSONL: pad + constructs per
                                 session). The only source that is a MEASUREMENT
                                 by construction, so it is probed first -- a guess
                                 that succeeds while real data exists would make
                                 the graph a picture of the guess.
  1. an explicit construct column  (`constructs`, `construct_state`, `node_values`)
  2. an explicit affect column     (`pad`, `affect`, `appraisal`)
  3. a metadata JSON column carrying construct keys per row

Only (0)-(3) are measurements. There is deliberately NO fallback that builds a
graph out of `tags` co-occurrence or `content` keywords. Both would produce a
graph-shaped artifact with real numbers in it that answers a different question,
and this project has already paid for that mistake: an instrument that reports a
confident figure for something it did not measure. A tag graph is a tag graph.

Exit codes: 0 = fitted, 2 = no construct-bearing signal (the expected outcome on
a memory-only store, and what it prints today because nobody has been elicited),
1 = error.

Usage:
  python tools/psyche_fit_pams.py                    # probe the default store
  python tools/psyche_fit_pams.py --json
  python tools/psyche_fit_pams.py --store PATH --probe-all
