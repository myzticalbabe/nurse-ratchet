"""PSYCHE Phase 6 -- REALTIME THERAPEUTIC AGENTS: the loop a stance is chosen in.

WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT REFUSES TO BE
---------------------------------------
A realtime agent here is the JITAI shape from digital mental health (Nahum-Shani
et al., "Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in Mobile Health", Annals
of Behavioral Medicine 2018): SENSE a state, DECIDE whether and how to intervene
now, DELIVER a bounded dose, and LEARN from what happened. Three of those four
words are doing real work:

  * SENSE uses the person's own graph and affect model, never a population prior.
  * "Whether" is a real decision. The JITAI literature is explicit that
    intervening at the wrong moment is worse than silence -- a person outside
    their window of tolerance cannot learn a skill, so a skills intervention
    delivered at arousal 0.9 teaches them that therapy does not work. So the loop
    has a RECEPTIVITY gate and a REGULATE stance that fires before SKILLS.
  * DELIVER is bounded: one stance, one short message, no stacked advice.

It is NOT a therapist, and the code says so rather than implying it. It does not
diagnose, does not name a disorder, and cannot replace a human -- on any elevated
risk signal it stops being an intervention engine and becomes a router to people.
That routing is the FIRST branch of `turn()`, before any stance is scored, and
`test_psyche_rt_agent` asserts it is exclusive. A safety check that can be
outranked by a utility score is not a safety check.

THE FOUR STANCES AND WHY THESE FOUR
-----------------------------------
Grounded in what the process literature actually measures, not in a modality:

  SAFETY      risk triage fired; deliver a resource, deliver nothing else.
  VALIDATE    emotional processing needs the experience acknowledged before any
              change work; skips straight past reframing resistance.
  REGULATE    arousal above the learning window; downregulate first.
  REFRAME     arousal workable and an appraisal is driving the distress --
              re-appraisal is the highest-value target when the belief, not the
              state, is what is stuck.
  SKILLS      workable state, no dominant misappraisal, avoidance is the active
              node -- approach/activation work.
  CONSOLIDATE nothing acute: name what worked so it is retrievable next time
              (this is the same move as `intuition.py` compiling a prototype).

Selection is deterministic: a utility per applicable stance, argmax, name
tiebreak. No sampling, so a session is reproducible and its audit is checkable.

    # Added 2026-11-01 with the coherence channel: "this traffic is going to be
    # the death of me" brings self + cessation + intent together and is still an
    # idiom. A fixed idiom is a MASK, not a lowered score -- the words are present
    # and mean the opposite, which is exactly the case exclusions exist for.
    "the death of me", "death of me",

#: Arousal above this is outside the window in which skills are learnable.
LEARNING_WINDOW_AROUSAL = 0.72

#: INDIRECT intent, as patterns rather than exact strings. Added 2026-11-01
#: after `tools/triage_eval.py` measured recall 0.76 on the dev corpus: all three
#: misses were euphemisms ("not be around anymore", "end it all", "rather not
#: wake up"), which is a MECHANISM gap -- an exact-phrase list only ever catches
#: the phrasings it was written around, and people do not speak in those. These
#: are families, so the next paraphrase is more likely to fall inside one.
CRISIS_PATTERNS: Tuple[Tuple[str, str], ...] = (
    ("indirect_absence", r"\b(not|no longer)\s+(be\s+around|be\s+here|wake\s+up)\b"),

    ("no_point", r"\b(no|not\s+see\s+the)\s+point\s+(in|to)?\s*(living|going\s+on|carrying\s+on)\b"),
)

#: CONCEPT LEXEMES for the coherence channel. Added 2026-11-01, replacing further
#: pattern tuning. The measured reason: the pattern set scored recall 1.00 on the
#: dev corpus after fitting and 0.00 on a fresh disjoint holdout written before
#: the fitting -- an exact-phrase list generalises at about zero, because people
#: do not speak in the phrasings it was written around. These are item FAMILIES,
#: each traceable to a published instrument rather than to a sentence I happened
#: to have in front of me:
#:
#:   cessation / desire / plan  -- Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale item
#:                                 groups (ideation, intent, method/plan/prep)
#:   hopeless / no_future / no_exit -- Beck Hopelessness Scale, SPS (no future
#:                                 thinking), entrapment items
#:   burden                    -- Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (PB)
#:   tether                    -- Reasons for Living Inventory
#:   self_harm                 -- deliberate self-harm, distinct from ideation
#:
#: Detection is COHERENCE, not a keyword: crisis requires several families to be
#: present and connected in one statement. "I could kill for a coffee" shares the
#: cessation family with "I want to die" and shares nothing else, and that is the
#: whole discrimination.
