"""PSYCHE -- construct elicitation, so construct data can exist at all.

THE PROBLEM
-----------
`tools/psyche_fit_pams.py` exits 2 because no store anywhere in this project holds
a construct reading: memory records carry tags, types and importance levels, and
nothing that says how avoidant this person was on Tuesday. The affect -> construct
bridge was therefore fitted against a SYNTHETIC ground truth, which validates the
estimator and says nothing about people.

The missing piece is not an algorithm. It is an instrument: something that asks,
records the answer in a schema the fitter can read, and does so together with a
PAD reading -- because a bridge between affect and constructs needs both halves
measured in the same moment. Asking them at different times would confound the map
with the drift.

WHAT IS IN THE BATTERY, AND WHAT IS NOT
---------------------------------------
Ten constructs, three items each, answered on a 0-4 scale, with at least one
reverse-scored item per construct so acquiescence (agreeing with everything) is
detectable rather than silently inflating every score.

These items are WRITTEN FOR THIS PROJECT. They are not a validated psychometric
instrument, they have no norms, and no factor structure has been established for
them. Calling them "the IPIP" or "the DASS" would be a false provenance claim, and
borrowing a validated inventory's item text would be both a licensing problem and
a validity claim this project cannot support. What they are is a consistent,
documented, reverse-balanced self-report that maps onto the same ten nodes the
graph already has, so that data can start existing and later be replaced by
something with standing.

The three affect sliders are likewise direct self-report on the PAD axes, not
inferred from text: an inferred PAD cannot be used to fit the bridge, because the
fit would then be recovering the inference model's assumptions instead of a
relationship between affect and constructs.

Usage (see `tools/elicit.py` for the CLI):

    session = new_session()
    answers = {"approach_1": 3, ...}
    record = score_session(answers, pad=(-0.4, 0.6, -0.3), session=session)
    record.to_row()          # one JSON object, ready for storage
