"""PSYCHE Phase 5 gate: compiled inference that can be graded.

- A configuration seen once is NOT a prototype (min_support); seen twice it is.
- An unfamiliar pattern returns known=False rather than a low-confidence guess.
- read_or_think falls back to the graph exactly when the fast path is not
  confident, and the fast path is measurably cheaper for the same question.
- Resolving a reading does NOT edit the prototype: a wrong intuition must be
  able to be wrong twice, so the error rate stays measurable. This is the test
  that protects the whole calibration story.
- Brier score is computed from resolutions only; with none it is None, not 0.0.
- No threshold is recommended from too little evidence.
