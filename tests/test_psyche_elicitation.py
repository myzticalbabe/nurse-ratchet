"""Tests for the construct battery, the store, and the fit that reads it.

The negative controls matter more than the happy paths here:

* a reverse-scored item must FLIP, and a session of straight 4s must land near
  the midpoint instead of maxing every node -- otherwise acquiescence reads as a
  perfect profile;
* an edited store line must FAIL the digest check. The first version of that
  check compared a recomputed hash to itself and could never fail, which is the
  same defect as the bridge tool's "hand map vs itself" bug;
* with too few sessions the graph fitter must produce NO edges rather than a
  plausible-looking pair.
