"""Tests for the fitted affect -> construct bridge.

What is being tested, precisely: that the ridge estimator recovers a matrix it was
handed (arithmetic), that the shipped file is the file the tool fits (drift), and
that a missing or malformed file falls back to the hand map instead of raising
(the bridge is an optimisation, not a load-bearing import).

NOT tested, because it cannot be: whether the bridge shape is right for people.
The ground truth is synthetic. A green run here is not evidence of validity and
must not be cited as such.
