"""Tests for the construction-grammar risk detector.

The corpus here is paired: every risk construction has a benign twin that shares
the FRAME and differs only in the slot fill. That pairing is the test. A detector
that matches frames without reading fills passes the first half and fails the
second, which is exactly the failure the previous two mechanisms had -- recall on
the phrasings they were written around, nothing on the rest.

Measured scores on the labelled corpus are NOT repeated here. They live in
`tools/triage_eval.py` output, next to the splits they came from, because a number
copied into a test suite is a number that stops being re-measured.
